# DESTimes Discrete Event Simulation Times
This repository contains two time classes to work in Discrete Event Simulation (DES).

Dependencies:
 - [c++11]  >=
 - [gcc]
 - [Boost 1.57] >=

### BRIValue (Boost Rational with Infinity Value): 
Is an extension of boost_rational\<int\> that allows using infinity.

### NDTime (Natural Deep Time):
Allows to work with the international standar time format hh:mm:ss:mmss and it also allows to work with smaller time units as: 
* microseconds 
* nanoseconds
* picoseconds
* femtoseconds

This time units are the smaller mesurable units in phisics
